				<br>The hospital, originally named after the philanthropist Mr. Robert Mitford of the civil service, who served many years in Dhaka as collector and later, as judge of the Provincial Court of Appeal, was the most important medical institution, not only in Dhaka, but in the whole of Eastern Bengal and Assam in the mid-19th century Robert Mitford died in Europe in 1836 but before his death he bequeathed the bulk of his property (about eight lakh rupees) to the Government of Bengal for public works in Dhaka. This was however, disputed by his successors in England and finally the Chancery Court partially decreed in favor of the Bengal Government in 1850. With this benevolent gift of the late Mr. Mitford, the construction of this hospital was started in 1854 on its present site, which was then known as Babu Bazar. Prior to thi, the site was earlier occupied by a Dutch kuthi.
